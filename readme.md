# Building a simple network ~ Saba Le Nassr

## Network 192.168.1.0/24
### - 3 hosts (Robert - Camille - Renaud) 
### - 1 server
### - website : www.google.com 

#
## This network is connected to the Internet through the server which has the IP address 192.168.1.2
## Available HTTP services: www.google.com 
## Accessable through the Browser of any of the 3 Hosts once connected
#
#

# How it was done: 
### Shout-out to Cristian for helping me out,
### Created the 3 Hosts and the server, put the IP Addresses in and connected through a " copper straight through " cable (through FastEthernet). 
### Inserted the DNS server on each Host and added the HTTP service (google) 
### Tested with ping and tested with the small Mail Icon "Add Simple PDU"
### Tests were successfull. :)
### Browser on my laptop was crashing whenever I tried to access Google, so I sended the file to Cristian who tested it for me and it was also successful
